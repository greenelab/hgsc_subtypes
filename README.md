## Summary

The repository contains instructions to replicate the analysis of identifying
high-grade serous ovarian cancer subtypes across Australian, American, and
Japanese populations. A full report of this analysis is published in G3:
Genes, Genomes, Genetics
([Way et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1534/g3.116.033514)).

 
In the study, we leverage data extracted from the bioconductor package
curatedOvarianData
([Ganzfried et al. 2013](http://doi.org/10.1093/database/bat013)) as well as a
 dataset we uploaded to GEO 
([GSE74357](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74357)). We
apply a unified, unsupervised bioinformatics pipeline to compare subtypes across
these populations and determine that specific subtypes are reliably identified.
The most replicable subtypes are mesenchymal-like and proliferative-like and
their sample representation was highly concordant with other independent
clustering studies performed on single populations.

We are currently working on adding African American HGSC samples to this
pipeline to determine the representation of HGSC subtypes in an additional
population.

## Contact

For all analysis or coding related questions please file a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/greenelab/hgsc_subtypes/issues)

## Environment

To ensure analysis reproducibility, all R/Bioconductor/Python packages are
versioned using a combination of
[checkpoint](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/checkpoint/index.html)
and [bioconda](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes).

To create an instance of this environment run the following:

```sh
conda env create --force --file environment.yml
source activate hgsc_subtypes

Rscript INSTALL.R
```

## Analyses

There are currently two pipelines in place to analyze hgsc subtypes, to
reproduce the results of either pipeline, run:

```sh
# Cross-population HGSC subtypes analysis 
bash hgsc_subtypes_pipeline.sh

# African American HGSC subtypes analysis
bash aaces_subtypes_pipeline.sh
```

## Data

All data was retrieved from curatedOvarianData except for the
[Mayo data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE74357)
and AACES data.
